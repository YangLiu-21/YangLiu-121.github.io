- ### Medical/Surgical Robotics: 
Development of high dexterity continuum manipulators, soft robots, and instruments for minimally invasive treatment of various medical/surgical applications.
- ### Modeling of Soft Robots: 
Study of mathematical modeling approaches and algorithms that  can solve the unknown correlation between actuation inputs, and outputs of internal distributed forces, tendon-tension transmission loss and deformation behavior of continuum manipulators.
- ### Control and Medical Imaging: 
Development of intelligent algorithms and medical imaging systems for human-in-the-loop control to further improve quality of the surgery and patient safety.
